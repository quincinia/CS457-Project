In the future, this project might be better accomplished using OOP
A SELECT command might return a temp table, which can then be queried to produce a narrower output table
  This is so that subqueries are able to be accomplished
The SELECT syntax might need to be completely overhauled because other commands like WHERE and GROUP BY may or may not be optional, and thus we can't hard-code expected inputs anymore

currently, duplicate attributes and incorrect data types are allowed

tables may need to be inverted so that the attributes go across the top
an "AttributesList" object may need to be made to hold all the available attributes, and to be able to easily query for a particular one

scan until semicolon; no hardcoding anymore
  do this for: SELECT
